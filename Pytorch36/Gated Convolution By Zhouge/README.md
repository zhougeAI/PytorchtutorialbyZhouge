# GatedConvolution_pytorch_by_Zhouge
A modified reimplemented in pytorch of inpainting model in Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution [http://jiahuiyu.com/deepfill2/]
This repo is transfered from the https://github.com/avalonstrel/GatedConvolution and https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting.

It is a model for image inpainting task. He implements the network structure and gated convolution in Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution,
but a little difference about the original structure described in Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution.
In refine network, he does not employ the contextual attention but a self-attention layer instead.
He adds batch norm to each layer.

* I rewrite the project structure more standardly.
* Rewrite the project structure in the style borrowed from EdgeConnect.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.0+


```
- Install PyTorch and dependencies from http://pytorch.org
- Install python requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
### 1) Images
We use [Places2](http://places2.csail.mit.edu), [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and [Paris Street-View](https://github.com/pathak22/context-encoder) datasets. To train a model on the full dataset, download datasets from official websites. 

After downloading, run [`scripts/flist.py`](scripts/flist.py) to generate train, test and validation set file lists. For example, to generate the training set file list on Places2 dataset run:
```bash
mkdir datasets
python ./scripts/flist.py --path path_to_places2_train_set --output ./datasets/places_train.flist
```

### 2) Irregular Masks
Our model is trained on the irregular mask dataset provided by [Liu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723). You can download publically available Irregular Mask Dataset from [their website](http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/partialconv).

Alternatively, you can download [Quick Draw Irregular Mask Dataset](https://github.com/karfly/qd-imd) by Karim Iskakov which is combination of 50 million strokes drawn by human hand.

Please use [`scripts/flist.py`](scripts/flist.py) to generate train, test and validation set masks file lists as explained above.

## Getting Started
Download the pre-trained models using the following links and copy them under `./checkpoints` directory.

[Places2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KyXz4W4SAvfsGh3NJ7XgdOv5t46o-8aa) | [CelebA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nkLOhzWL-w2euo0U6amhz7HVzqNC5rqb) | [Paris-StreetView](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cGwDaZqDcqYU7kDuEbMXa9TP3uDJRBR1)

Alternatively, you can run the following script to automatically download the pre-trained models:
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_model.sh
```

### 1) Training
To train the model, create a `config.yaml` file similar to the [example config file](https://github.com/knazeri/edge-connect/blob/master/config.yml.example) and copy it under your checkpoints directory. Read the [configuration](#model-configuration) guide for more information on model configuration.

GatedConvolution is trained only on one stage: 
To train the model:
```bash
python train.py  --checkpoints [path to checkpoints]
```

### 2) Testing
To test the model, create a `config.yaml` file similar to the [example config file](config.yml.example) and copy it under your checkpoints directory. Read the [configuration](#model-configuration) guide for more information on model configuration.

You can test the model. You need to provide an input image (image with a mask) and a grayscale mask file. Please make sure that the mask file covers the entire mask region in the input image. To test the model:
```bash
python test.py \
  --checkpoints [path to checkpoints] \
  --input [path to input directory or file] \
  --mask [path to masks directory or mask file] \
  --output [path to the output directory]
```

We provide some test examples under `./examples` directory. Please download the [pre-trained models](#getting-started) and run:
```bash
python test.py \
  --checkpoints ./checkpoints/places2 
  --input ./examples/places2/images 
  --mask ./examples/places2/masks
  --output ./checkpoints/results
```
This script will inpaint all images in `./examples/places2/images` using their corresponding masks in `./examples/places2/mask` directory and saves the results in `./checkpoints/results` directory. By default `test.py` script is run on stage 3 (`--model=3`).

### 3) Evaluating
To evaluate the model, you need to first run the model in [test mode](#testing) against your validation set and save the results on disk. We provide a utility [`./scripts/metrics.py`](scripts/metrics.py) to evaluate the model using PSNR, SSIM and Mean Absolute Error:

```bash
python ./scripts/metrics.py --data-path [path to validation set] --output-path [path to model output]
```

To measure the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID score) run [`./scripts/fid_score.py`](scripts/fid_score.py). We utilize the PyTorch implementation of FID [from here](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) which uses the pretrained weights from PyTorch's Inception model.

```bash
python ./scripts/fid_score.py --path [path to validation, path to model output] --gpu [GPU id to use]
```

### Model Configuration

The model configuration is stored in a [`config.yaml`](config.yml.example) file under your checkpoints directory. The following tables provide the documentation for all the options available in the configuration file:
